Enum
====
In Java, an enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type that enables you to define a collection of constants. 
It provides a way to define a variable that can hold a set of predefined constants, making your code more readable and less error-prone.

Basic Syntax of Enum
--------------------
An enum is defined using the enum keyword followed by the name of the enum and its constants. Hereâ€™s a simple example:


enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}
