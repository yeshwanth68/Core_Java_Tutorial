Types of Inheritance:
--------------------
1.Single Inheritance - A single class inherits from a parent class
2.Multilevel Inheritance - A class inherits from a subclass, which in turn inherits from another class
3.Multiple Inheritance - not applicable
4.Hierrachical Inheritance - Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.
5.Hybrid Inheritance - not applicable


Note: Java does not support multiple inheritance (a class cannot inherit from more than one class directly). 
However, this can be achieved using interfaces.

Advantages of Inheritance:
-------------------------
Code Reusability: Common code can be written in the superclass and reused by subclasses, reducing redundancy.
Code Organization: Relationships between classes are clearly established, improving code maintainability.
Extensibility: New classes can be easily added, extending existing functionality without modifying existing code.
