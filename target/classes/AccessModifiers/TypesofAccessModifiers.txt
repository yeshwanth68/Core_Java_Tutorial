In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to set the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, 
variables, and constructors. There are four types of access modifiers:

1.public
2.private
3.protected
4.(default) (no keyword, known as package-private)

1. public Access Modifier:
Visibility: The public modifier allows access from anywhere in the program, both within the same package and from other packages.

2. private Access Modifier:
Visibility: The private modifier restricts access to within the same class. It is not accessible from other classes, even within the same package.

3. protected Access Modifier:
Visibility: The protected modifier allows access within the same package and in subclasses (even if the subclass is in a different package).

4. Default (Package-private) Access Modifier:
Visibility: If no access modifier is specified, it is considered default (also known as package-private), meaning the member is accessible within the same package only.


Key Points:
----------
public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the class.
protected: Accessible within the same package and in subclasses.
default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.
