Collections
===========
Collections represent a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects. Collections can be used to 
perform various operations such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion. 
The Collections Framework includes interfaces, classes, and algorithms to support data structure operations.
