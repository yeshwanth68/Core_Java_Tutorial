Exceptions
==========
Exceptions are conditions that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. 
They are typically caused by conditions that a program can catch and handle.

Characteristics of Exceptions:
------------------------------
Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile time. If a method can throw a checked exception, 
it must either handle it with a try-catch block or declare it using the throws keyword in the method signature. 

For example:

IOException
SQLException

Unchecked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are not checked at compile time. 
They derive from RuntimeException and can occur anywhere in the program. 

Common examples include:

NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ArithmeticException
