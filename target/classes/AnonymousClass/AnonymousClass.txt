Anonymous Class:
===============

An anonymous class in Java is a class that does not have a name and is declared and instantiated in a single expression. 
They are used primarily for instantiating classes or interfaces at the point of use, typically in scenarios where you want to provide a 
specific implementation of an interface or a subclass of a class without the need to formally define a separate named class.

Characteristics of Anonymous Classes
------------------------------------
1.No Name: As the name implies, anonymous classes do not have a name.
2.Instantiation: They are created at the point of instantiation, which makes them useful for concise code.
3.Subclassing or Implementing: Anonymous classes can either extend a superclass or implement an interface.
