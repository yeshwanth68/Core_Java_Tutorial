Object Class:
-------------
The Object class in Java is the root superclass of all classes. Every class in Java implicitly or explicitly inherits from the Object class. 
This means that the Object class provides some default behavior that all Java objects can use.

Key Points About Object Class:
------------------------------
Root of the Java Class Hierarchy: All classes in Java inherit from the Object class, either directly or indirectly.

Common Methods for All Objects: The Object class defines several methods that are available to every Java object, such as toString(), 
equals(), hashCode(), getClass(), clone(), notify(), notifyAll(), and wait().


1. toString():
* Returns a string representation of the object.
* By default, the toString() method returns a string that consists of the class name followed by the "@" 
sign and the object's hashcode in hexadecimal form.

2. equals(Object obj):
* Compares the current object with the specified object for equality.
* By default, equals() checks for reference equality (i.e., whether both references point to the same object).


3. hashCode():
* Returns an integer hash code for the object.
* The hashCode() method is often used in conjunction with the equals() method, 
especially when objects are stored in collections such as HashMap or HashSet.


4. getClass():
* Returns the runtime class of the object.
* This method is used to get the Class object corresponding to the runtime type of the object.


5. clone():
* Creates and returns a copy (clone) of the object.
* The clone() method can only be used if the class implements the Cloneable interface, otherwise it throws a CloneNotSupportedException.

6. notify(), notifyAll(), wait():
* These methods are part of Java's thread synchronization mechanism.
notify() and notifyAll() are used to wake up threads that are waiting for a particular objectâ€™s lock, while wait() causes the current thread to 
wait until another thread invokes notify() or notifyAll() on that object.


7. finalize() (Deprecated from Java 9):
* Called by the garbage collector before the object is destroyed.
* It's deprecated and should no longer be relied upon for cleanup operations.
