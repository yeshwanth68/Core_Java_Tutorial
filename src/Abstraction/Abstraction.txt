Abstraction:
-----------
Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. 
It is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of a class and only showing the essential features or functionalities to the users. 
In simpler terms, abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

Java achieves abstraction through:

1.Abstract Classes
2.Interfaces


1. Abstract Class
An abstract class in Java is a class that is declared with the abstract keyword. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly; 
they are meant to be subclassed. 
An abstract class can have both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).


2. Interfaces
An interface in Java is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods (until Java 8, where interfaces can also have default and static methods). 
Interfaces specify what a class must do but not how it does it.
