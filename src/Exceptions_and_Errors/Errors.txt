Errors
======
Errors are serious problems that a reasonable application should not catch. 
They are typically related to the Java runtime system and indicate a failure that is outside the control of the program. 
Errors are often caused by system-level issues.

Characteristics of Errors:
-------------------------
1. Not Recoverable: Errors generally indicate serious problems, such as:

OutOfMemoryError: Not enough memory to allocate new objects.
StackOverflowError: The stack has overflowed due to too many nested method calls.
NoClassDefFoundError: A class that was available at compile time is not found at runtime.

2. Inherit from Error: All errors are subclasses of the Error class.
